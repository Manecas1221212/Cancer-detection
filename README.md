# Cancer-detection
My participation in a Kaggle challenge of image classification for Breast Cancer detection : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection

In this project I worked with TPU for the first time, levereging it to train my TF models.
The dataset was heavely unbalanced so I had to upsample the positive cases.
In terms of Modelling I used a simple transfer learning model, at first I froze the backbone, but unfreezing it would achieve better results.
